# Introduction

* James McShane - Cloud Engineering team @ HealthPartners
* Started OpenShift back in late 2016
* Production apps in late 2017
* Onboarding teams rapidly to our environment

---

# Basic Principles

* Don't touch VMs manually
* Stay up to date with minimal effort
* Validate all changes before production
* Prepare for the future

???

* After a couple false starts, we've been able to patch the environment every month 
* got to 3.11 within a couple days of release
---

# Getting Started

.center[![OpenshiftAnsible](/rhug-feb-2019/images/openshift-ansible.png)]

???

* RedHat has published much of what it takes to manage an out of the box openshift cluster
* Given infrastructure exists and has pre-reqs set up
  * This is where the rubber hits the road
* Version specific code(!)

---

# Our Infrastructure Choices

* UCS Chassis
* RHEV for Virtualization
* VMWare for Virtualization (stay tuned)
* F5 external load balancer
* A few network components to be discussed
* NetApp for Storage
* Ansible for automation

---

# Jobs to be Done

* Building clusters
* Patching clusters
* Scaling clusters
* Updating openshift software
* Updating cluster admin level components
* Day 2 operations - observability, disaster recovery

---

# Code Structure

* Put all of our code in a single repository
  * Master branch does not contain openshift-ansible
* Version specific branches that we clone the openshift-ansible version release branch to
* Most of our code is standalone, except for the turnkey stuff

---

# `openshiftcluster`

![OpenshiftCluster](/rhug-feb-2019/images/openshiftcluster.png)
![OpenshiftCluster311](/rhug-feb-2019/images/openshiftcluster-3.11.png)

???

* You can see the repository structure in the master branch here
* vs 3.11 branch which has openshift-ansible code checked out

---

# Referencing `openshift-ansible`

```
- name: Scale up new nodes
  import_playbook: openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-node/scaleup.yml
  tags: scaleup
```

* Hacking `group_vars`

```
find . -path './openshift-ansible/playbooks/*' -type d -depth 3 | 
  xargs -L1 ln -s ../../../group_vars $1/group_vars

find . -path './openshift-ansible/playbooks/*' -type d -depth 4 | 
  xargs -L1 ln -s ../../../../group_vars $1/group_vars

find . -path './openshift-ansible/playbooks/*' -type d -depth 5 | 
  xargs -L1 ln -s ../../../../../group_vars $1/group_vars

find . -path './openshift-ansible/playbooks/*' -type d -depth 6 |
  xargs -L1 ln -s ../../../../../../group_vars $1/group_vars
```

# Customizing OpenShift

* An out of the box cluster is useful for experimentation, but not production
* What things do we add:
  * LDAP group management
  * Connect to our Artifactory docker repository
  * Cleanup scripts
  * Trident installation
  * Security scanning
  * Router customization
  * Additional `SecurityContextConstraints`
  * And much more...

???

* Lots of stuff to do in an out of the box cluster

--- 

# Managing our customization

* Define three types of Ansible roles
  * OC only - interact with OpenShift master API
  * Infra only - manage packages and files on the VMs
  * OpenShift software - interact with `openshift-ansible`
* Defined jobs that can run arbitrary roles of each type by name and target

---

# Takeaways

* Separated the concerns of infrastructure automation, infrastructure access, and orchestration
* Automation through Ansible, extending the RedHat openshift-ansible repository
* Infrastructure access & centralization through Ansible Tower
* Orchestrated the complexity using Jenkins jobs
